# 📓 journal

Welcome to my **journal** - a repository where I document my daily progress, coding practice, problem-solving approaches and learning reflections.

## 🌱 Purpose

- Practice **data structures and algorithms** daily.
- Improve my coding and programming skills and write more efficient code.
- Revisit and master concepts I feel like I have not understood.
- Build consistency and track progress over time.

## 📅 Structure

Each day's work is stored in its own directory with the format:
YYYY-MM-DD-topic(s)

Inside each directory:
- Files with solutions and code experiments.
- A `README.md` summary of the concepts I studied, Problems I solved and lessons I learned that day.

## 📚 Key Resources
- [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms)
- Leetcode
- Python Docs
- JavaScript Docs

## 🧠 Philosophy

> *“Little by little, a little becomes a lot.”*

This journal is not about perfection — it's about progress, reflection, and never stopping.
